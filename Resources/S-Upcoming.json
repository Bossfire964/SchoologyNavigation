      "We will be doing Weekly Music/Practice Logs! I would like you to log each day what you do to better yourself as a musician or performer. Simple as that! Some of you may have done these before where you are required to practice a specific amount every day or each week. I am not requiring that. I only ask that you be honest about what you do. Possible things to put down on this form could be, \"I practiced my C, D, and G Major scales for 30 minutes,\" \"I listened and analyzed this recording of the NY Philharmonic playing Mahler's 6th Symphony,\" 'I looked up videos of people performing on my instrument to see what I can do better,\" etc. I want to see what you all are doing so that I can best assist you!",
      "Please do not just put \"Guitar\" or \"Drums\" or whatever in as your Focus for the day. Try to be specific. This is just as much for me as it is for you. ",
      "Here is how you should submit your assignments..."

      "You must have at least 4 items on your tablecloth, they must be all different (three different plates is not 3 different items).",
      "They do not have to be items you would normally find on a table (i.e, plates, forks, cups).",
      "All items must remain on the surface after the tablecloth has been removed.",
      "If you think of some other creative way to demonstrate inertia, contact me and we can work it out.",
      "Yes, you may celebrate on camera when you have succeeded. Nay, it is encouraged."
